  "description": "Navier Trovi has spent her entire life preparing to become the perfect empress, and all her training has paid off: she is the well-respected ruler of the Eastern Empire alongside Emperor Sovieshu, who has been both her friend and her arranged husband since childhood. Navier has never considered any other life, nor has she ever had any reason to-until Sovieshu brings home a mistress and demands a divorce. With her carefully constructed world suddenly turned upside down, Navier takes a drastic action of her own: after accepting her divorce, she immediately remarries the handsome Prince Heinrey of the Western Kingdom. As the new ruler of a competing nation, Navier's skills and wits are put to the test as she navigates the turbulent waters of both international and interpersonal relationships-and is forced to reassess everything she thought she knew about high society, politics, and love.",
