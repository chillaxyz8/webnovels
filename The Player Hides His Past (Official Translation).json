  "description": "The real world is suddenly ambushed by rifts that threaten to spill out monsters from the VR game “Chronicles of Arcana.” These rifts can only be closed by “players,” people who have awakened as their in-game characters with all the same stats and skills. Unfortunately for protagonist Lee Hoyeol, his awakening is the opposite of cool as his avatar happens to be the one he made during the height of his awkward phase in middle school, giving him all the mannerisms and speech of an absolute cringelord. Just how will he go on to become the hero humanity needs most?",
