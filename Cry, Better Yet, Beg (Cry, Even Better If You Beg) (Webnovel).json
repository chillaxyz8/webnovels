  "description": "Orphaned at a young age, Layla Llewellyn feels like the luckiest girl in the world after she moves in with her uncle Bill, a gardener who lives on the scenic Arvis estate in the Berg Empire. To Layla, Arvis seems like paradise; she loves to explore the vast forest, always bringing her notebook to record the wildlife she encounters. She especially loves the birds, watching them with awe as they hatch and grow from fluffy chicks into beautiful birds. Duke Herhardt, the young, handsome lord of Arvis, is also interested in birdsâ€”and in Layla. But the difference, is he's interested in birds because he likes to hunt them... and he's interested in Layla because he likes to make her cry. If a lovely bird is trapped in a golden cage, which will she choose: a life of luxury, or freedom?\n\n*English Translations from Yonder. Uploads continue from where fan translations stop.",
