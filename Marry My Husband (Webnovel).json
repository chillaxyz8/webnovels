So when Jiwon somehow opens her eyes and finds herself ten years in the past, she's determined to change her fate. But in order for Jiwon to avoid meeting the some dismal end, someone has to take her place. Jiwon sets out to forge a new future for herself and get revenge for the past by setting up her backstabbing best friend with her cheating husband. clearly, they're a match made in heaven―or rather, a match made in hell.",
