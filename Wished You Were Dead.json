  "description": "Karloi Croitan has one rule: never trust a Deluah. Ever since his childhood, Duke Deluah has murdered the royal family one by one through devious schemes. So when the duke's daughter, Evonne, becomes the queen, Karloi wants nothing more than for her to disappear from his life. But as he learns more about his queen and her suspicious past, he begins to realize Evonne might not be who he thinks she is. And as much as Karloi despises his wife, Evonne can't bring herself to loathe him--but she also has to play the part of her father's puppet in order to survive. Can this seemingly ill-matched king and queen work through a maze of secrets, schemes, and sorcery to find their way to each other?",
