  "description": "All his life, he sought power. In his pursuit of strength, he churned the world into rivers of blood and was eventually titled the \"Demon Lord of Strength.\" However, all his efforts are vanquished when he loses to a party of heroes.\n\nLosers do not get to complain.\n\n\"If you're born again, I hope that you will live a good life.\"\n\nThat was why the Demon Lord accepted the gibberish from the hero as he lay dying.\n\nTo his surprise, he finds himself back in the past when he used to have a different name, Zich Steelwall. How will this ex-Demon Lord fare living a good life this time?\n\n*Side stories only. These are official translations from the Yonder app.",
